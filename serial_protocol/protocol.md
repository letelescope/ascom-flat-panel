# Com protocol

In this scenario a flat panel is made of two things
- A light panel with variable brightness
- A motorized cover

The firmware updates the state of the flat panel upon instructions of the ASCOM driver. The communication protocol is serial based. The serial connection is established via USB.  

## Messages 

The protocol is thus "message" based. 
- Both the driver and the flat panel (and hence this firmware) exchange single line messages; ie terminated by '\n'.
- A message is structured as TYPE:MESSAGE, where TYPE is in "COMMAND, RESULT, ERROR" and MESSAGE is alaphanumerical with spaces and "@"

The driver emmits and the firmware handles the incoming "COMMAND" messages. This kind of message is stuctured as 

COMMAND:NAME[@ARGS]

where NAME is [A-Z_]+ and ARGS may be optional or mandatory and their nature may depend on the command. For instance for a COMMAND:BRIGHTNESS_SET@ARGS message the ARGS are mandatory and should consists of a single "int"

The firware reponse with 
- either a RESULT:CMD_NAME}@MSG   if operation succeeded
- or an ERROR:ERR_MESSAGE@DETAILS if anything went wrong

## Command Details 

### Ping 

- Incoming message :  COMMAND:PING 
- Args             :  Ignored
- Serial response  :  RESULT:PING@PONG
- Serial error     :  Never 
  
### Info 

- Incoming message : COMMAND:INFO 
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:INFO@{RESULT_INFO}, where {RESULT_INFO} is the value of the firmware informations ex Le TÃ©lescope - Ivry sur Seine - Flat Panel Firmware v1.0.
- Serial error     : Never 

### Get Brightness

- Incoming message : COMMAND:BRIGHTNESS_GET 
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:BRIGHTNESS_GET@{brightness}, where {brightness} is the current value of the brightness of the panel, as an (int), ex: 50.
- Serial error     : Never

### Set Brightness

- Incoming message : COMMAND:BRIGHTNESS_SET@{desired_value}
- Args             : (uint) desired_value
- Serial response  : RESULT:BRIGHTNESS_SET@{panel.brightness}, where {panel.brightness} is the value of the  brightness member after being set, as an (int).
- Serial error     : Errors in three cases
  - {desired_value} not parsable as int => "INVALID_BRIGHTNESS@Wanted brightness {desired_value} is not a number"
  - {desired_value} <0                  => "INVALID_BRIGHTNESS@Wanted brightness {desired_value} is negative"
  - {desired_value} >  MAX_BRIGHTNESS   => "INVALID_BRIGHTNESS@Wanted brightness {desired_value} is bigger than max allowed value 1023"

### Reset brightness

- Incoming message : COMMAND:BRIGHTNESS_RESET
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:BRIGHTNESS_RESET@{0}
- Serial error     : Never

### Get cover state 

- Incoming message : COMMAND:COVER_GET
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:COVER_GET@{panel.cover}, where panel.cover is string human readable translation of the current cover state. Possible values are in [OPEN, OPENING, CLOSING, CLOSED]
- Serial error     : Never

### Open cover

- Incoming message : COMMAND:COVER_OPEN
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:COVER_OPEN@OK
- Serial error     : Errors in two cases
  - panel is not calibrated              => "SERVO_NO_CALIBRATED@Run command COVER_CALIBRATION_RUN first"
  - panel is neither CLOSING nor CLOSING => "COVER_OPEN_IMPOSSIBLE@Cover is not closed nor closing.""

### Close cover

- Incoming message : COMMAND:COVER_CLOSE
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:COVER_CLOSE@OK
- Serial error     : Errors in two cases
  - panel is not calibrated              => "SERVO_NO_CALIBRATED@Run command COVER_CALIBRATION_RUN first"
  - panel is neither OPEN nor OPENING    => "COVER_CLOSE_IMPOSSIBLE@Cover is not open nor opening."


### Run calibration

- Incoming message : COMMAND:CALIBRATION_RUN
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:CALIBRATION_RUN@OK
- Serial error     : Never

WARNING: Disconect the right arm from the servo before runing the calibration

### Get calibration

- Incoming message : COMMAND:CALIBRATION_GET
- Args             : Ignored
- Serial response  : RESULT:CALIBRATION_GET@slope={panel.calibration.slope} - intercept={panel.calibration.intercept}
- Serial error     : if panel is not calibrated => "SERVO_NO_CALIBRATED@Run command COVER_CALIBRATION_RUN first"

### Unknown commands

- Incoming message : Any message not in the previously mentionned
- Args             : Ignored
